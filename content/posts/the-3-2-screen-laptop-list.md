### Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Titanium G1

### HP Specter x360 14t-ea0000

[https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-spectre-x360-laptop-14t-ea000-touch-1q881av-1](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-spectre-x360-laptop-14t-ea000-touch-1q881av-1 "https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-spectre-x360-laptop-14t-ea000-touch-1q881av-1")

This, in the Poseidon blue, is my current (as of this post) daily driver. For the past few months, there has been a battle to get this laptop fully working under Linux. But as of 5.12.1-ARCH, all major functionality is working. I don't believe the Waccom Screen & Pen is working, nor is the fingerprint setting. But I use neither, so it's not an issue for me.

Performance is great. I'm running the i7-1165G7 with 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD with Optane, and the OLED 3000x2000 13.5" Screen. Performance leaves nothing to be desired for the size of the laptop, and the screen really steals the show. There is just something about the vibrancy and picture of the clean that makes it look like nothing else I've seen. Webcam does not do well in low light.

What kills the laptop is how warm it gets. The CPU does a solid job of staying cool, but the chassis is aluminum and all the heat is absorbed by it.  There is ways under Windows where you can configure the Fan to stay on for longer so more heat is exhausted by the system, but no such way exist in Linux right now. The BIOS does not offer much configuration, and I believe HP left most of it up to Windows to do.

Still some quirks that make the linux performance less than ideal, but that does not take away from this great laptop. Man, I wish this laptop had a 4G Modem option.

## 2018

### Huawei Matebook X Pro (2018)

I currently own this laptop, and used it for about a year as a daily driver. I used to run Linux on it, and it now functions as my backup laptop.

A very nice device with a brilliant screen. I have mine configured with 16gb of RAM, 512GB of NVMe, and a i7-8550u. Powerful enough for daily use, but due to the abnormal cooling solution, you can't run heavy workloads (such as compiling Rust) for long. Even then, there is much to be desired. Battery Life was a solid 6 hours, but an absolutely horrible webcam. Keyboard, Trackpad, and overall user experience was very nice.

No linux issues to speak of. Ran Fedora and then Arch without issue using GNOME.
